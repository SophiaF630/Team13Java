      The Integrated Virtual Learning Environment (IVLE) is a NUS' custom designed and built Learning Management System for the NUS community. It is designed to facilitate and supplement teaching at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

      <p class="w3-text-grey"> IVLE is designed to:
      <br>1. Ease the administrative work of the teaching staff
<br>2. Provide more opportunities and avenues for staff and students to collaborate and communicate
<br>3. Acts as a teaching portfolio for staff
<br>4. Facilitate student-to-student collaboration
<br>5. Promote explorative and independent learning
<br>6. Promote greater understanding of subjects taught through the use of self-assessments and polls
<br>7. Provide a one-stop acess to all the learning resources at NUS
<br><br>To achieve its objectives, IVLE has a rich set of online tools and resources. From class rosters with photographs, online syllabus, assignment repositories, lesson plans, forums, chat rooms, assessments, surveys, project and peer management, web lectures, class and exam time tables, library e-reserves and virtual communities, NUSâ€™ learning management system combines all the resources needed to manage and supplement course modules effectively.</p>
